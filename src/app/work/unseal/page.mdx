## Overview

DataForge Solutions, a global manufacturing company, approached Syyft with a complex data integration challenge. With operations spread across multiple countries and a variety of legacy systems, they struggled to consolidate their data for effective analysis and decision-making.

Our team at Syyft proposed a comprehensive data integration strategy, centered around a robust ETL pipeline and a cloud-based data warehouse. We began by conducting a thorough analysis of DataForge's existing systems and data flows.

We designed a scalable ETL solution using Apache NiFi for data ingestion and Spark for data transformation. This allowed us to handle the diverse data formats and volumes from DataForge's various systems. We implemented data quality checks and cleansing processes to ensure the integrity of the data flowing through the pipeline.

For the data warehouse, we leveraged Snowflake's cloud data platform, providing DataForge with a scalable and flexible solution for storing and analyzing their consolidated data. We also implemented a data governance framework to ensure compliance with data privacy regulations across different regions.
